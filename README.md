The AWE dataset contains 7 files, "Normal", "Fault-1", "Fault-2", "Fault-3", "Fault-4", "Fault-5" respectively represent six classes of health conditions, and "Label" represents the corresponding labels for each health condition. Each data file is composed of 1000Ã—4000 sampling points of vibration signals, where 1000 denote the data acquisition duration and 4000 denote the sampling frequency.

Note: The data is collected from real industrial facilities via destructive experiments, and each fault condition is formed by artificial destruction. Therefore, we really appreciate the joint efforts of our partner company who provide sufficient time and equipment for the experiment.
